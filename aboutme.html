	<h1> About Me </h1>
	<p> I studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (I'm about to graduate!) When I was younger, I wanted to be a paleontologist and could give my family a personalized tour of the dinosaur exhibits at the Chicago Field Museum. I eventually decided to pursue a degree in engineering because I believed the idea that engineers can 'do anything.' I spend my free time designing and redesigning websites and applying for jobs all while listening to Harry Potter audiobooks (read by the great Jim Dale) with unhealthy repetition.</p>
